a package containing functions to be used within the shiny app

This was my idea for a group project that had originally been completed by myself, Andrea Wan @andywwwww and Marshall Malino @spearman666.
What is included in this package is an extension of what we worked on; everything included here has been my own work on our finished project, which can be found in the repository andywwwww/group3_project. There, I did work on the functions and partly on the app, Marshall did most of the work on the shiny app, and Andrea did the work on the package documentation and on the repositories overall presentation.
